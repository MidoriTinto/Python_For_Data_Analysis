The results above show the percentage of male and female pupils within each of the groups represented in the column 'average_column'. Interestingly, the proportion of male and female within groups is fairly equal with the exception of the 'master's degree' group in which the percentage of male pupils is higher ( e.g within the group 'masters degree' (pupils whose parent's have a master's degree) 43.42% are females and 56.58% are males. The group master's degree represent only 7.6% of the whole dataframe. Looking across all groups it seems that within groups male and females are almost equally distributed. This changes in the 'master's degree' group which appear to have more male pupils than female pupils."

        "*Previous research have shown that in general female pupils tend to achieve better grades than boys. Although this initially might have pointed towards a sex-based difference in reality the differences are a result of a combination of attitudes and social factors (https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/auggirls-overtake-boys-in-a-level-and-gcse-maths-so-are-they-smarter). Results here have shown that in general girls do tend to achieve better grades regardless of their ethnicity or their parent's educational background. Interestingly, pupils whose parents achieved a higher education degree tend to do better in exams compared to those pupils whose parents had only some high school or college education. In addition, pupils from ethnicity E achieved higher scores. In the UK the categories are based on the census for each country and they vary slightly thus making it difficult to determine what group is group E without knowing the source of the data.*\n"
